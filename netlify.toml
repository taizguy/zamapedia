# Example redirect: if you deploy your proxy elsewhere (https://my-proxy.example.com),
# you can proxy /api/* to it during production by adding redirects like below.
# Note: Netlify's redirects configuration doesn't support environment variables in the "to" field,
# so replace the target with your deployed server URL.

# [[redirects]]
#   from = "/api/*"
#   to = "https://my-proxy.example.com/:splat"
#   status = 200
#   force = true

# If you convert the server to Netlify Functions, you could map /api/fetch to a function:
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/fetch"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/fetch"
  status = 200
  force = true
